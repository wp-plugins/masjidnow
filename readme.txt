== Description ==

Provides a widget for displaying daily iqamah timings from [MasjidNow.com](http://masjidnow.com) for any mosque that has uploaded it's timings there.
The timings are displayed along-side adhan timings which can be adjusted from the plugin's settings if necessary.

Also provides a shortcode for displaying the monthly iqamah timings table.

The daily timings widgets are easily customizable with different colors, and can even be used with different languages.

**Features:**

* Display adhan and iqamah times
* Interactive with ability to click forward and backward to see different day's timings

* Show monthly information (ex. Jummah times)
* Choose from different themes or colors
* Usable with any language site

To be able to show timings, you must have [signed up your mosque](http://masjidnow.com) at MasjidNow.com.

ATTENTION: You must clear the cache after updating the masjid's salah timings. You can do this by going the MasjidNow Settings page and clicking "Clear Cache".

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `masjidnow` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Daily Timings Sidebar Widget =

1. Place the `MasjidNow Daily Iqamah Timings` widget in the correct area through the `Appearance` > `Widgets` menu in WordPress.
2. Change the widget's settings to your preference, then press save.

= Daily Timings Shortcode =

A shortcode is a small piece of code that you can copy and paste on one of your WordPress pages; The shortcode will output something when it is viewed by a visitor to your website. 

MasjidNow has shortcodes for both daily and monthly timings. When you put one of our shortcodes on your WordPress site, it will output our timings.

To show the daily timings table anywhere on your site:

1. Place the shortcode `[masjidnow_daily masjid_id=XXXX]`, replacing XXXX with your mosque's MasjidNow.com id. This can be found at the end of the MasjidNow.com url for your mosque.
For example, http://masjidnow.com/masjids/5312 has a masjid_id of 5312. Simple!

You can customize the daily shortcode by adding more parameters. For example, to set the background color of the table, you can write:

`[masjidnow_daily masjid_id=XXXX bg_color=#FF0000]`

Or to show the monthly information at the bottom of the table:

`[masjidnow_daily masjid_id=XXXX show_monthly_info=true]`

**Accepted Parameters for Daily Timings:**

*All parameters are optional*

* **masjid_id** - *(integer)* This is the masjid id that can be found from the MasjidNow.com masjid page url
* **show_adhan** - *(true or false)* Whether to show the adhan timings from MasjidNow.com
* **show_monthly_info** - *(true or false)* Whether to show the additional monthly info at the bottom of the table (ex. Jummah/Friday Prayer times) 
* **show_name** - *(true or false)* Whether to show the name of the mosque at the bottom of the table
* **bg_color** - *(color code like #FFFF00)* What color to make the background of the table. Leave blank to make the background transparent.
* **primary_color** - *(color code like #FFFF00)* What color to make the text.
* **secondary_color** - *(color code like #FFFF00)* What color to make the alternating rows of the table.
* **extra_info** - *(text)* Any text that you would like to display under the timings. This should be surrounded by quotes. Accepts basic HTML.

= Monthly Timings Table Shortcode =

A shortcode is a small piece of code that you can copy and paste on one of your WordPress pages; The shortcode will output something when it is viewed by a visitor to your website. 

MasjidNow has shortcodes for both daily and monthly timings. When you put one of our shortcodes on your WordPress site, it will output our timings.

To show the monthly timings table anywhere on your site:

1. Place the shortcode `[masjidnow_monthly masjid_id=XXXX]`, replacing XXXX with your mosque's MasjidNow.com id. This can be found at the end of the MasjidNow.com url for your mosque.
For example, http://masjidnow.com/masjids/5312 has a masjid_id of 5312. Simple!

To show the adhan timings schedule instead of the iqamah timings schedule, simply change the short code to `[masjidnow_monthly_adhan masjid_id=XXXX]`.

You can customize the monthly shortcodes by adding more parameters. For example, to set the title of the Monthly Timings (next to the month and year), you can write
`[masjidnow_monthly masjid_id=XXXX title="Our Azan Timings"]`

**Accepted Parameters for Monthly Timings Table:**

* **masjid_id** - *(integer)* This is the masjid id that can be found from the MasjidNow.com masjid page url
* **title** - *(text)* The text that displays at the top of the timings table next to the month and year. Should be surrounded by quotes.


= Using the Widget in a Different Language =

The default language for the widgets and shortcodes is English. 
However, you can change how the plugin displays the names of the prayers and the titles for "Adhan" and "Iqamah" by going to the MasjidNow Settings page, under `Settings` in your WordPress Installation.

For example, if you would prefer 'Isha' be spelled 'Ichaa', then you can change this on the MasjidNow Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the widget displaying "Please set your website's timezone..." when I have already set it? =

Unfortunately, due to the way that WordPress provides timezone information, you must set the timezone option to a "named" timezone. For example, instead of choosing "UTC-4", you must choose something like "New York". 

= Why is my widget or shortcode showing outdated or old timings? =

The timings that are being displayed have been saved to your WordPress installation (aka "cached") so that it doesn't have to connect to the MasjidNow database everytime that your page is loaded.
This ensures that timings are displayed quickly and don't slow down your website.

To clear these cached timings, go to your WordPress Admin panel, and click Settings > MasjidNow Settings on the left hand side. Then click the button labeled "Clear Cache". Your timings will then be updated
from the MasjidNow website.

= My website is not in English, can I change the language that is displayed? =

No problem. Just go to your WordPress admin page, and click Settings on the left hand side. Once there, click "MasjidNow Settings".

If you scroll down, you will see an area where you can set what text will be displayed for each prayer name, and for "Adhan" and "Iqamah".

For example, French users can enter "Ichaa" instead of "Isha", and all of MasjidNow's timings will display "Ichaa" instead of "Isha".
